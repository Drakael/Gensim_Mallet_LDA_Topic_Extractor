Check the numbers of each player in comparison to the numbers of the rest of the players that year(s), and youll see that Im fairly close with this ranking system (which is primarily based on Total Player Rating) for four consecutive years.

Nf-ID: #N:cdp:1483500342:000:6673 Nf-From: cdp.UUCP!cpr Apr 16 16:49:00 1993 Lines: 130 From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: From Israeli press. Madness. /* Written 4:34 pm Apr 16, 1993 by in igc:mideast.forum */ /* ---------- \"From Israeli press. Madness.\" ---------- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS. Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Avivs time). Friday local Tel Avivs paper, affiliated with Maariv. Date: 19 February 1993 Journalist: Guy Ehrlich Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan (Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories. Excerpts from the article: \"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one way or another insane\". A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it woundnt be easy either. Yet after they began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking. The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness. (...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We called such soldiers H.I. Hit by the Intifada. Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The keys of my fathers car must be ready for in advance, so that I can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I dont want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it instantly. I know it is my nerve: Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only there I become normal.(...) (...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother. It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I was delighted to see it. My pal fired three bullets, two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit him straight in his ass. We both felt that wed pulled off something. Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab, blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: Shut up and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: All right, wait a moment. I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didnt know what to say. (...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it. We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We had hitem so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too, so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in. But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like beasts of prey. We couldnt explain what had happened to us. We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we felt the whole day very badly. (...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in. This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel Godlike of sorts.\" (...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. Why shouldnt I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why shouldnt I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there.\" Transl. by Israel Shahak. \n"

      "3 From: (Clinton/Gore 92) Subject: CLINTON: Background BRiefing in Vancouver 4.4.93 Organization: Project GNU, Free Software Foundation, 675 Mass. Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA +1 (617) 876-3296 Lines: 993 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary (Vancouver, British Columbia) ______________________________________________________________ BACKGROUND BRIEFING BY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS April 4, 1993 Canada Place Vancouver, British Columbia 9:40 A.M. PST Folks, were about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning. The President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia, and its valued at $1.6 billion. Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points. First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform. All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs. All our Fiscal Year 93 funds currently are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin tomorrow. The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers. All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government. Third, the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year. The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform. In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you. Fourth, Id like to note the special importance of trade and investment. I think its fair to say that Russias capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars. No collection of governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do so. And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship. They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship. If it would be helpful Id be prepared to run down the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just give you some general background on what these programs are. Ill do it quickly and then Ill be glad to take questions. The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance. This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure theres at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities. Thats $194 million in grant -- that is from Food for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress. Well also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies, and thats $30 million. The second item is concessional food sales. As you know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia. Its important to us and its important to Russia that we continue that relationship. The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program. The value over the next seven months is $700 million. These are concessional terms. The exact terms have not been worked out, but I think its fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal. The third program is a collection of private sector support. We think this is one of the most important things were going to do. Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow. And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million. And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses. The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis. He has also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation. This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia. The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself. I think its fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia. You see that we have a total of $48 million in programs, various programs. The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that were launching. The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia. The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement. This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration. This is a demonstration project. What wed like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union. We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether its with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction. And so weve decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units. Well be working very closely with the Russian military on this. And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project. The sixth area is energy in the environment. They are two issues that the President feels strongly about. Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much environmental damage. Ive talked a little bit about trade and investment, about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side. Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment. We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time. And the point Id like to make here is, trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an analogy, as arms reductions was in the 70s and 80s. And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly important. Youll notice that the United States is going to support Russias membership in the GATT. Russia has had observer status. Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT. We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount, a very important goal. And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT. We are also supporting their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences. Youll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project. Id like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. We think this is a very important development. We think well get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference, the G-7 conference. Before I take any further questions, Id like to defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance objectives with you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements. Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs. The first is the program of $130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program. That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $130 million. The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled. This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility. And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system. So we add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years. So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, and Belarussians. Belarus, for example, has just, in the last couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY93 funds for safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory. And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I, an agreement to accede to NPT. So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with them. And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process. Q The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan. Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if its the same one, why do you feel its necessary? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Its not the same deal. Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil field. This is a new investment project. Its a polar lights oil development and renovation project, and its being announced today. So its completely new. Q Can you tell us more about whats involved? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes. Conoco, like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things. One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia. The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what Russia needs. So we think this deal is very, very good development for Russia. The Russians do as well, and its good for an American company. And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee. Q So its to search and also to renovate fields that are already there? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thats right. Q On that point, should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals, or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 billion? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, as you know, Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated. And we think it will. And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, there will be $2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services. Q That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their wont be -- and their will or there wont be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Theres a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia. We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will soak up a lot of that interest. But I think the interest may even extend beyond that. And if so, the government will respond. Q Whats the current year budget costs of that $2-billion agreement should it go forward? And is there any current year budget costs -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ill have to refer you to Ex-Im for that. I dont know the details of that. Q The concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program. USDA has the funds, we dont need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds. There will be a hit in the budget. Id refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that. Q Can you talk about the Democracy Corps? Q and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Why dont I start with the Democracy Corps first. I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization, private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis. And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area. And so the administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts. And so this is a presidential initiative. It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union. And were very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government, but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation. Q any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word yet on FY94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $300 million the President talked about? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The administration is requesting additional funds in FY94 of $700 million. What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform. Hell be consulting with the Congress. When he returns to Washington, hell be consulting also with the other ally governments, and well make a decision at that time. Q Two questions about the $700 billion agricultural money. First of all, I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food. So why did you decide to do it that way? Secondly, could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russias inability to pay. How does this fit into that situation? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As you know, the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia. I think between 1991 and 92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through the Commodity Credit Corporation. That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products. On December 1 of last year, 92, the Russian government stopped its payments on that program. They are now in arrears to us on that program, and therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that program. And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales. And I think we have two ways to do that. Weve announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program. But we do not have sufficient authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked for a concessional loan program. I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but a long-term concessional loan program would. And that is what this program is. It will provide, once the final details are worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal. And then from years seven through 15, which is the life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent. And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this very important grain relationship, which is important for them, and its important for the American farm community. Q I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the Russians failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, is that right? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let me be explicit about that. We are prevented under the law to from continuing the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russias arrearages to the United States. All of you know about those arrearages. They total about, I think, around $640 million. USDA can give you an exact figure. So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance, knowing that we couldnt take it from the grant programs because we dont have sufficient authority there, we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program weve used to great effect in other parts of the world. And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution. I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments. Q Where do those funds actually come from? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: They come from the Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDAs authority. USDA has the authority to spend these funds. We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds. And I want to make that general point again: Everything in this package, the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow. And its very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, that we meet these commitments. And we are confident well be able to do so. Q How did you arrive at the figure of $700 million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually have a range from 0 to -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Theres a reason for it. The reason was that the Russian government told us thats about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time. And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia wont require the same level of food imports from the West. Q I would imagine theres going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia. Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with some of the other republics? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, were very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union. We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries. In the area of food sales, we have been active with Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia. We will continue that. And I think its fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and theyre hard-hitting. Q Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing, legalities, bureaucracy? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight, not only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment. And Id like to refer to the point I made at the beginning. Were convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support Russia long-term -- were convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private sector can do that. We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector. It is a very good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production. Thats what the Russian government has told us it wants to do, and so thats why we have made such a major emphasis on it. Thats why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton. And were hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to support them. Q My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We think he is. I would note that President Yeltsins Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector. He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector. We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee. And were looking forward to the work. Q What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program? And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here? It depends on the program itself. In most cases, though, we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to the intended source. Thats an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money. We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs. But they are all quite different. For instance, in the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food. For grant medical assistance, weve been working through Project Hope which is a private organization. For the housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, well be working with a group of American PBOs. On some of the democratization projects, were working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations. Were working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed. So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and theyre all going to be carried out in slightly different ways. Some directly with the Russian government, some with Russian citizens. Q The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the President has to do on that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, as George noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship. The President has noted that. I think its fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and well get back to the Russian government. Q You were not prepared for these questions when you got here? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We were prepared for these questions. Weve looked at them. But were not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend. They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik. They require consultation with the Congress. They require consultation with the American Jewish community. And were very sensitive to those concerns. And so well want to go back and talk to them before we take any action. Q Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As I said at the beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts. In effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow. And thats the advantage of this particular initiative. Q If this, as the President says, is a long-term, long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow, why arent you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think weve been clear about that. The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has. We have a major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by Representative Gephardt and well want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything. And well also want to consult with our allies. So thats where it stands now. Q Weve been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated. Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that weve said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were some funds that were left over from FY92. And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended. We didnt use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY92 funds. We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs. And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans. We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA. We could not go forward legally, and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we found it. Q Where, for example, are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thats from the Freedom Support Act funds. Q In other words, all of the money is being directly spent in new ways, so to speak -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the second chart, its broken down into grant and credits. And if you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding. A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year 92. The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the legislative history of those funds. Q cooperation -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: From FY 92? I dont have the exact figure. It was not a considerable figure. Q Could you tell us please, has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of whats happened here -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Both presidents, President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this issue this morning. In fact, we havent yet gotten to security and arms control related issues. That will be this mornings session. I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us. Weve been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them. Up to this point, this has been a very important negotiation thats been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev. And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially. But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, I dont yet know. In a couple hours well know. Q? Just a follow-up on the financing here. Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since its all current year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace thats been earmarked and put it into this fund? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There are smoke and mirrors here, and I think its an important point to note. We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding. Were going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the privatization effort, the housing effort. And weve already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment. We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point: This package is FY 93. Its funds that we have. And were going to do what we say were going to do. And the President feels very strongly about that. In the past there is a legacy that the western governments, the combination of governments, put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons were not able to meet them, were determined, and the President is determined, to carry out every single program in this package. And well do it. But we do have a longer-term commitment, and thats part of the discussions on economics this weekend. Were looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform. And weve told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year. Q taken it way from any -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, we havent. Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia? The answer is no, we have not done so. Q In terms of funding, there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else. Doesnt that, in fact, support the -- theory? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Not at all. I dont think it does. Thats a particular example, and the example is grain sales. The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months. You all know about Russias debt problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments. So we looked for a way to do two things: to meet Russias requirement for grain. Theyre a net grain importer on a massive scale, and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia. And we simply look for another way to finance that. And we have legislative authority to do it. This program has been successful in other areas. We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, but we thought we should now. Q Isnt this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I dont think thats a fair characterization. A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992. This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made. But we had a long six to seven week review of this program. We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration. But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not been filled out with a program. There was no number attached to it. In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, is another Clinton initiative. Further, we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons. And President Clinton has responded to that. And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project were going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers. I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience. And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, were hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government, to achieve that objective. So I would not characterize it that way at all. And as most of you know, I am a career civil servant. I was in the last administration. Im very familiar with what the last administration did. And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia. Q Theres been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people. Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because its being administered by the Russian government? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that -- I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that its intended -- for which its intended. And so were going to take great care -- AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that theyre reaching their source. I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government. Some of these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, with businesses. The private enterprise support is another example of that. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one area that weve been looking at very, very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs. They would be working very closely, of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime contractors. But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended. Q When would the democracy corps start? Exactly when do you see this happening? How would get it off the ground? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps. I think its fair to say that were going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks. Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st. But in effect weve already started, because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia. And weve said that we will be helpful. Weve also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government. We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another. We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts. Q Excuse me. How much of this $1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I dont have any figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that. Q This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and Im sorry to say that. No, this package -- President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package. And he was briefed intensively on this. He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package. He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package. And I think its fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago. We have been refining it ever since. We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy. And so its been evolving. But this particular package has been together for about two weeks. Q Where is Yeltsins input into this then? There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsins views about specifically what was needed and so forth. Is that in the out years? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, its both. President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them. And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package. We listened to him. On the privatization effort, we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details. So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way. But let me get at the other part of your question. The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake. And were looking for his ideas. The President has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in housing. But were looking for Russian ideas not. We need to consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active. Q Theres essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: This particular package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago. We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development, and so this weekend weve primarily talked about future, about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, which is our base objective here. Q I noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers. Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Youre right; we have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States. Part of the housing initiative, its not just to build housing units, its to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions. Q money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have not yet allocated any money for that. Q Why not? Q of the $6 million is going to build 450 housing units. Isnt that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If you want to do housing the right way, its not just the building the framework of a house, youve got to think about all the utilities. Youve got to think about the purchase of land. Youve got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth. And its also retraining. Its not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia. We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well. This is responding to a request from the Russian government. Q of the $6 million will go to retrain -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thats right. Q Are you talking about apartment buildings or single -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Were talking about single, individual dwellings. Q Youre saying that only 450 families will be served by this? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: What I want to -- I thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project. What we didnt want to do -- given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money. What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done. I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that. And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future . But we want to do it wisely; we want to spend the money wisely. Q What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russias reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money theyre supposed to pay back, especially considering their other debt problem? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, look, I think its important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform. Its got to be a collective Western effort, and were looking to our allies to do more as well. But beyond that, its really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform. We can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do so, which is consistent with our national interests. Q Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States? So what is it about this program that does this? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform. We are convinced that if reformers stay in power, then well be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia. So its not a simple question. You cant just say that this program is the answer. Its a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it. Q And then on the question of Russias ability to repay, what convinces you theyll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the Russian government has made a commitment to repay, and what were hoping is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans. Q substantial government-to-government loan weve ever gotten into with the Russians? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I dont want to answer authoritatively on that. I dont go back 20 or 30 years on this. But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans. This is a different type of effort. Q government loans in any other sector that you recall? I know it wasnt done in -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think its fair to say this is a new and unique effort. END10:25 A.M. PDT \n"

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered, the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined. Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary. [4/92; thanks to ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122) Why doesnt XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget? XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123) How do I query the user synchronously using Xt? It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a \"yes\" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call) { int answer; answer = AskUser(w, \"Really Quit?\"); if (RET_YES == answer) { answer = AskUser(w, \"Are You Really Positive?\"); if (RET_YES == answer) exit(0); } } A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for \"OK\", \"Cancel\" and \"Help\" or equivalents: int AskUser(w, string) Widget w; char *string; { int answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */ Widget dialog; /* could cache&carry, but ...*/ Arg args[3]; int n = 0; XtAppContext context; n=0; XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string, XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++; XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++; dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer); XtManageChild(dialog); context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w); while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) { XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll); } XtDestroyWidget(dialog); /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; } The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user. The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices: void response(w, client, call) Widget w; XtPointer client; XtPointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case XmCR_OK: *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */ break; case XmCR_CANCEL: *answer = RET_NO; break; case XmCR_HELP: *answer = RET_HELP; break; default: return; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there. [Thanks to Dan Heller further code is in Dans R3/contrib WidgetWrap library. 2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 124) How do I determine the name of an existing widget? I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is. Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects. If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want. Note that it depends on the widgets internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4. #include <X11/CoreP.h> #include <X11/Xresource.h> String XtName (widget) Widget widget; /* WILL work with non-widget objects */ { return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name); } [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers 9/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125) Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? Im doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program: > canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */ > ... > window = XtWindow(canvas); /* get the window associated with the widget */ > ... > XDrawLine (...,window,...); /* produces error */ The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget. Using a window id of NULL (\"no window\") could create the error that you describe. It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126) Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage? The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you dont want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error: 1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasnt clean, and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which arent good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory. [10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 127) How can my application tell if it is being run under X? A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server: display = XOpenDisplay(display_name); if (display) { do X stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set]. This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128) How do I make a \"busy cursor\" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application? The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it wont affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window): unsigned long valuemask; XSetWindowAttributes attributes; /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask = (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask); attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch); /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */ XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0, 65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly, CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events. [thanks to Andrew Wason Dan Heller and 11/90,5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 129) How do I fork without hanging my parent X program? An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. Alternatively, before execing make this call, which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec. (void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1); [Thanks to Janet Anstett Gordon Freedman 2/91. Greg Holmberg 3/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130) Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler? No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in OReilly Volume 6 are in error. [Thanks to Pete Ware and Donna Converse 5/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131) What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors? You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldnt be doing in any case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132) How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input? Its very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor. A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your programs attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns. It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers. Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isnt input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data youve read before. The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data: if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input. [courtesy Dan Heller 8/90; 5/91; Ollie Jones 6/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 133) How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget? You can do this using XSendEvent(); its likely that youre not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event. If youre sending events to your own application, then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server. Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want. [courtesy Mark A. Horstman 11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134) Why doesnt anything appear when I run this simple program? > ... > the_window = XCreateSimpleWindow(the_display, > root_window,size_hints.x,size_hints.y, > size_hints.width,size_hints.height,BORDER_WIDTH, > BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen), > WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen)); > ... > XSelectInput(the_display,the_window,ExposureMask|ButtonPressMask| > ButtonReleaseMask); > XMapWindow(the_display,the_window); > ... > XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100); > ... You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. Youll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped: while (!done) { XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event); switch (the_event.type) { case Expose: /* On expose events, redraw */ XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100); break; ... } } Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations dont set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code: ... the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */ the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */ the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window, GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values); ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa. The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent. They may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all. Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the users preference for foreground and background. And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135) What is the difference between a Screen and a screen? The Screen is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the screen or screen_number is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection. The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number. In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen. (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have \"Display\" in the names -- XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136) Can I use C++ with X11? Motif? XView? The X11R4/5 header files are compatible with C++. The Motif 1.1 header files are usable as is inside extern \"C\" {...}. However, the definition of String in Intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other String class and needs to be worked around. Some other projects which can help: WWL, a set of C++ classes by Jean-Daniel Fekete to wrap X Toolkit widgets, available via anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/WWL-1.2.tar.Z [7/92] or lri.lri.fr (129.175.15.1) as pub/WWL-1.2.tar.Z. It works by building a set of C++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the widgets. The C++ InterViews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous FTP from interviews.stanford.edu. InterViews uses a box/glue model similar to that of TeX for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user interfaces. Some of its sample applications include a WYSIWIG document editor (doc), a MacDraw-like drawing program (idraw) and an interface builder (ibuild). THINGS, a class library written at the Rome Air Force Base by the Strategic Air Command, available as freeware on archive sites. Motif++ is a public-domain library that defines C++ class wrappers for Motif 1.1; it adds an \"application\" class for, e.g., initializing X, and also integrates WCL and the Xbae widget set. This work was developed by Ronald van Loon based on X++, a set of bindings done by the University of Lowell Graphics Research Laboratory. The current sources are available from decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) as /pub/X11/motif++.21.jul.92.tar.Z. The source code examples for Doug Youngs \"Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and OSF/Motif\" [ISBN 0-13-630252-1] do not include \"widget wrappers\" but do include a set of classes that encapsulates higher-level facilities commonly needed by Motif- or other Xt-based applications; check export in ~ftp/contrib/young.c++.tar.Z.

A product called \"Commonview\" by Glockenspiel Ltd, Ireland (??) apparently is a C++-based toolkit for multiple window systems, including PM, Windows, and X/Motif. Xv++ is sold by Qualix (415-572-0200; fax -1300); it implements an interface from the GIL files that Suns OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 produces to Xview wrapper classes in C++. UIT is a set of C++ classes embedding the XView toolkit; it is intended for use with Suns OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 builder tool. Sources are on export.mit.edu.au as UIT.tar.Z. Version 2 was released 5/28/92. Also of likely use is ObjectCenter (Saber-C++). And a reasonable alternative to all of the above is ParcPlaces (formerly Solbournes) Object Interface.

No. Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re-read by clients. The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed. If youre sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel. However, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants. By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 139) How do I create a transparent window? A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices: - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers support the extension. - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware. Note that there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\". - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly. [thanks to der Mouse, 3/92; see also The X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this last option] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 140) Why doesnt GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values? When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue. [Thanks to Chris Flatters and Ken Whaley 2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 141) Why does every color I allocate show up as black? Make sure youre using 16 bits and not 8. The red, green, and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black. [Thanks to Paul Asente, 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 142) Why cant my program get a standard colormap? I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the standard colormap, but it doesnt work. XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first. [1/91; from der Mouse ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 143) Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined. This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage. You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144) How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it. Because X is asynchronous, there isnt a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window. [courtesy Ken Lee 4/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145) Can I have two applications draw to the same window? Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared]. The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.] Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection. [mostly courtesy Phil Karlton 6/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 146) Why cant my program work with tvtwm or swm? A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen): /* Function Name: GetVRoot * Description: Gets the root window, even if its a virtual root * Arguments: the display and the screen * Returns: the root window for the client */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display *dpy; int scr; { Window rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int numChildren; Window root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom __SWM_VROOT = None; int i; __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, \"__SWM_VROOT\", False); XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren); for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) { Atom actual_type; int actual_format; long nitems, bytesafter; Window *newRoot = NULL; if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1, False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems, &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) { root = *newRoot; break; } } return root; } [courtesy David Elliott Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91] A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147) How do I keep a window from being resized by the user? Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. [1/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148) How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times? Its rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isnt overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running. The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows). [thanks to der Mouse 7/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 149) How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X? There is no easy way. Unless youre willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents. [Thanks to (der Mouse), 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib? Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking. There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks. You have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server. Thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code. On most UNIXish implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that. Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action. [Thanks to (der Mouse), 4/93] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text? Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it \"by hand\" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically: 1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it. 2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage). 3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation. 4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 5) render I2 Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph. [courtesy der Mouse Eric Taylor and Ken Lee 11/90; Liam Quin 12/90] InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for rendering rotated fonts in X. It could be one source of example code. [Brian R. Smith 3/91] Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine requests. 10/91] The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font. The xvertext package by Alan Richardson is a set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle. Version 3.0 was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z. OReillys X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 152) What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?) There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others. The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 tape; it is also available by sending \"send docs registry\" to the xstuff mail server. To register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send to be sure to include a postal address for confirmation.

      "6 From: (Clipper Chip Announcement) Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption Organization: National Institute of Standards & Technology Distribution: na Lines: 282 Note: This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717. --------------------------------------------------- THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 16, 1993 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement. The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans. Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer. It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files. While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals. A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has been developed by government engineers. The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology. It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone. It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically. At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans. Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General. Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices. In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryptions dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists. We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities. In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: -- the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data, under proper court or other legal order, when necessary to protect our citizens; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information. This infrastructure of high-speed networks (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as todays telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use. The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758. --------------------------------- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q: Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? A: No. \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q: Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device. What would they have to do to decipher the message? A: They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers. The key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q: Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A: The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities. At this point, the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q: How strong is the security in the device? How can I be sure how strong the security is? A: This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today. While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q: Whose decision was it to propose this product? A: The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision. This approach has been endorsed by the President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q: Who was consulted? The Congress? Industry? A: We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy. We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q: Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A: The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers. Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q: Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"? A: Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, California, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers. The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q: How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A: We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices. Q: If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A: This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review. The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product.\" There is a false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is an \"either-or\" proposition. Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper Chip\" and similar encryption techniques. Q: What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A: It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q: Will the devices be exportable? Will other devices that use the government hardware? A: Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements. Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices. The same is true for other encryption devices. One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad. With this in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad. We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products. "

      "10 From: Subject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring Lines: 163 Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1 Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here. A few points need to be clarified: The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects. It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load. Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor. Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation (\"orange\" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service. Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems. The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod) Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey. This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel. This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper. (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel) The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor. In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device. Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions. If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor. Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end. If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two. This normally does not present a shock hazard. HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path. If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire. It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat. With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire. Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction. I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment. The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling. This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly. The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer. Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground. There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (dont flame ME on this, Im just telling you where the field comes from, not its health effect, as far as Im concerned, the jury is still out on this.) Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels. This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral. The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor. If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above. The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another. In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire. Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such. The appliance manufacturers dont want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors dont want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances. No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, its primarily for lightning protection. People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isnt a legal grounding conductor. Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" with ground is. Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor. The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath. You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you dont have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes. \"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesnt have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance. You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield. \"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box. I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box. You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever. On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available. It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dont install it. The interrupter doesnt depend on the ground to trip. It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path. For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFIs, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my 93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasnt changed. It might be renumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Any three of them must be non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them). A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC and CA meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle. This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere. Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles to the ABC one. Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal). Algorithm: Is the sphere well defined? (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure). (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure). (3) Find the plane ABC and check that D does not lie in it (=> failure). Yes. Find its centre. (1) Find the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC. (2) Find their point of intersection (P). (3) Find the normal to the plane ABC passing through P (line N). (4) Find the plane containing N and D; find the point E on the ABC circle in this plane (if D lies on N, take E as A). (4) Find the perpendicular bisector of ED (line L) (5) Find the point of intersection of N and L (Q). Q is the centre of the desired sphere Pictures: (1) In the plane ABC A P B C (2) At right-angles to ABC, in the plane containing N and D E D line N --------------------P-------------Q--------------------------- Numerically: If ED << EP then Q will be very close to P (relative to the radius of the ABC circle) and subject to error. Its best to choose D so that the least of AD, BD and CD is larger than for any other choice. -- Bob Douglas Computing Services, University of Oxford Internet: Address: 13 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 6NN, UK Telephone: +44-865-273211 \n"

Perhaps they were \"strong in the faith?\" --------------------------- [No, I dont believe that Paul can overrule God. However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience. The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles. There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal. The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ. The decision not to impose the Law on them didnt say that the Law was abolished. It simply acknowledged that fact that it didnt apply to Gentiles. Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath. Thus they continued to obey the Law. The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it). Jesus dealt mostly with Jews. I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience. He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others). The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law. He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law. However theres more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law. In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Pauls apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus commendation of the Law. At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded. Again, this issue isnt one of the abolition of the Law. In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that thats not what he intends to say. Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness. But ultimately its an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Pauls comments are not the worlds clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading. But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed. For its purpose of convicting of sin, its important that it not be relaxed. However for Christians, its not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law. While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion. The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law. The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact thats not Jesus approach. Jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details. Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws. Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions. Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity. (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Pauls conclusion is similar. While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the \"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath. He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards. The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law. Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision. As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, hes looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies. He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct. On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble. Its unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts. Look at the way terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the current context. Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S. I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in. Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned about the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family values. --clh] \n"

That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \"pink unicorn\" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that \"pink unicorns\" dont exist because I havent seen them, this conclusion has its foundation in observation and theory. A \"pink unicorn\", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from \"more primitive\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however, has no such correspondence with anything (IMO).

I disagree with you profoundly on this. I havent defined God as existence - in fact, I havent defined God.

Im making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy. Im not trying to convince you of anything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you that they can logically prove God or that they have \"evidence\" or ..., then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).

Helsingius? * * * IDENTITY ======== _____ <1.1> What is `identity on the internet? Generally, today peoples `identity on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging face in the electronic realm. This is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information, for example People see this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage. Some obsolete forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist. In email messages, additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient. This information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination. This type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET protocol to a lesser extent. Forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon. Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created. Tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes. _____ <1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet? The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication, privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification. But there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems. Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication, and one classic example of the problems associated with it is H.G.Wells ``War of the Worlds radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress. Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious. People and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery. However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is harmful. A professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him. Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many prejudices are useful! A scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors. Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria. On the other side of the connection, the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance. Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating `credit (not necessarily financial) and `ownership and `usage. Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. Many government functions and services are based on identification, and law enforcement frequently hinges on it. Hence, employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures. But when does identification invade privacy? The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent, will literally be magnified exponentially. _____ <1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background? Your email address may contain information that influences peoples perceptions of your background. The address may `identify you as from a department at a particular university, an employee at a company, or a government worker. It may contain your last name, initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both. In the US some are based on parts of social security numbers. Others are in the form u2338 where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system. Standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood. However, none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all. The fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network cabling distributions. The only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as continental domains). Typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail. Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise. (For more information, see the FAQs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below.) However, UNIX utilities exist to aid in the quest (see the question on this). Common Suffixes --------------- .us United States .uk United Kingdom .ca Canada .fi Finland .au Australia .edu university or college .com commercial organization .org other (e.g. nonprofit organization) .gov government .mil military site _____ <1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address? One simple way is to send email to that address, asking. Another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e. although the postmasters job is more to help find user IDs of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems. The sysadmin (i.e. may also be able to supply information. Users with related email address may have information. However, all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally. One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the UNIX utility finger. The basic syntax is: finger This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named. The response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format. Possible responses are as follows: - A message `unknown host meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect, two lines with no information and ???. - A message In real life: ??? in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger utility may return this response in other situations. - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database. At some sites finger can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a `finger In general this is often considered weak security, however, because `attackers know valid user IDs to `crack passwords. More information on the fields returned by `finger is given below. More information on `finger and locating peoples email addresses is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility). Just as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use them to find out about you. You can `finger yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you. Be careful when modifying `finger data; virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information. In one amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm, through the use of an anonymous tip and finger. See the book Cyberspace by K. Hafner and J. Markoff. _____ <1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet? Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the Internet for a variety of reasons. One is the inherent fluidity of `cyberspace where people emerge and submerge frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community. Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual identification in the real world. The arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world. Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to be. A persons mailing address is far from an identification of an individual. - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password, either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address in the From: line. - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From: line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers. The status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email. Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with todays internet protocols affecting identification on the internet: - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly. For example, standards for mail address `munging or `parsing tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail. - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites, and there are delays in the propagation of this data. - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers. - A whole slew of problems is associated with `nameservers; if they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even the operation of what constitutes `updating has different interpretations at different sites. The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees. Today a large proportion of internet traffic is email, comprising millions of messages. _____ <1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet? Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification. However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises in privacy. Promising new cryptographic techniques may make digital signatures and digital authentication common (see below). Also, the trend in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted information. On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity (such as remailers) are forthcoming. See below. PRIVACY ======= _____ <2.1> What is `privacy on the internet? Generally, while `privacy has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches. In other words, others may obtain data associated with your account, but not without your permission. These ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains. Some users dont expect or want any privacy, some expect and demand it. _____ <2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet? This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing passionate opinions. On the internet, some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent. Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it. However, the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong legal precedents and court cases). The fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation. _____ <2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks? - `Theoretically people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the Internet could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the sheer volume and general noise inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources. - Technologies exist to `tap magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection. Less obscurely, any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even possible. - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can filter and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use. Known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks tend to emerge locally. Note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography. _____ <2.4> How (in)secure is my account? By default, not very. There are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal system is to use a password, but if it is `weak (i.e. easy to guess) this security is significantly diminished. Somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain users of the system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to others. This means that they may read any file in your account without detection. Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing or `process accounting information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored. This data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other suspicious activities on the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links (described in man ln). UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the passwd file, incorrect login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.). Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons: - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else. - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks. - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users, including anonymous ones. - Some software exacerbates these problems. See the section on ``X Windows (in)security. Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines: - Choose a secure password. Change it periodically. - Make sure to logout always. - Do not leave a machine unattended for long. - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password. - Avoid password references in email. - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file. - Use utilities like `xlock to protect a station, but be considerate. Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password. There are only several basic situations where UNIX prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or changing your password. Situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat). Also, be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords. (Thanks to Jim Mattson for contributions here.) _____ <2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories? The most important privacy considerations are related to file rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x (`execute) right on your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory. For a directory, x means that access to the files (or subdirectories) in the directory is possible -- if you know their names. To list the contents of the directory, however, requires the r right. By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference. The default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell with `umask. The details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of UNIX. Consult man pages on `chmod and `ls. Examples -------- traver.lance % ls -ld ~ drwx------ 15 ld231782 1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/ Here is a listing of the rights associated with a users home directory, denoted by `~. The columns at the left identify what rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user. For directories, the `x right means that contents (file and subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point. They cant even `see any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy is completely invisible to them. traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-r--r-- 1 ld231782 35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw------- 1 ld231782 35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg Here the modes on the file `msg were changed to take away rights from `group and `other. Note that `ls -l <file> requires both the r right to get the list of files and subdirectories, and the x right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example, suppose the directory `foo has rights dr--r--r--, the following is possible: ls foo These commands would fail independent of file rights: ls -l foo ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo If the directory `foo has rights d--x--x--x, the following are possible if it is known beforehand that `foo contains an r readable file named `file: ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo The following commands fail: ls foo ls -l foo (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann for contributions here.) _____ <2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows? X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via graphical windows. In this case the `client is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources (such as windows or a mouse) and the `server is the machine that provides them. In many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server. The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast to a server at a remote location from the client. Unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated security considerations. The primary security and privacy issue associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer. Currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X Windows. Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws, early versions of the X Window system are extremely insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix:0.0 by any regular user. There are no protections from this type of access in these versions. The problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted machine is himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity): > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and > mutual trust does not exist. With the access control list, the `xhost command may prevent some naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0 evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is ``xhost +[name] where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled. Public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily (such as flip or slowly mirror the screen image, or cause pixels to melt down to the bottom) have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users. Much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses. (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted security mode of `xhost has been jokingly referred to as ``X Hanging Open, Security Terrible.). New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority file and magic cookies. Remote machines must have a code in the .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server. Many older programs and even new vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with `magic cookies. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission. X11R5 also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms. Try `man Xsecurity to find out what is supported at your site. Even though improved security mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex. (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen Jim Mattson and Bill Marshall for contributions here.) _____ <2.7> How (in)secure is my email? By default, not very. The characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa. Virtually every computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting to and from it. When you write a mail message, by default it is being sent in ASCII, and since the standard is virtually universal, there is no intrinsic privacy. Despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design. Some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows: - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the `spool files at a local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message), such as a university. - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally. - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety. This means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient. - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden. - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms. This `feature can be disabled. Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal). See the sections on ``email privacy and ``email policies. _____ <2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings? As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke certain `privileges such as emailing, USENET posting or reading certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented. Currently there are virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access. Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations. In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email, regarding that persons objectionable email or postings. `abusive posters to USENET are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the `net. (The debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots or censoring unpopular opinions.) System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to squelch severe cases of abuse. In general, however, by tradition Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message (referred to as ``hitting the `n key), or to `plonk annoying posters (according to the Hackers Dictionary, the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file). In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email. USENET postings are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or entire groups (such as a university campus). Restrictions are most commonly associated with the following `abuses: - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material - `ad hominem attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups `mail-bombing: inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings. Most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail written by White House staff members of the Bush administration. Following are some guidelines: - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy. - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private communication. - Use a disclaimer. - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars or simply dont post). - Avoid posting information that could be construed to be proprietary or `internal. The following references are available from ftp.eff.com (see also the section on ``internet use policies): /pub/academic/banned.1991 /pub/academic/banned.1992 --- Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991 and 1992 including USENET hierarchies. /pub/academic/cases --- This is an on-line collection of information about specific computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed description of the items in the directory. /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability --- Notes on university liability for Usenet. _____ <2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity? The public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the UNIX utility `finger described above. - You have control over most of this information with the utility `chfn, the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use `passwd -f). - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering. - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is fingering you and even to vary the .plan file sent to them. - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file in your home directory. Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved. One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you (such as your full name). You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally. You may be able to remotely login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not physically near. These are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof. Consult man pages on the chmod command and the default file mode. Generally, files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators. To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting and remailing services that are very recently being established. See below. ______ <2.10> Who is my sysadmin? What does s/he know about me? The requirements and screening for getting a system administration job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at universities. Many UNIX systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often `hacking. In general, commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are extremely strict. The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you used and at what times. S/he may have a record (backups) of files on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when you send email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either. S/he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using, both locally and elsewhere. Administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to track `strange or `unusual activity, which can potentially be misused. ______ <2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet? For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet. Furthermore, large parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as prohibiting commercial use). Some high-level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services). Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic. The `alternative hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere). From the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders are pursued. For example, verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email complaints may ensue). More astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as `alt.sex regularly have the highest traffic). ______ <2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet? Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy. Others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards. The internet is growing to become a completely global, international superhighway for data, and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that many people consider completely private (such as their local hard drives) will literally be inches from global network connections. Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet. Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform introduction of `privacy enhanced mail (PEM) which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards. The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy (such as with surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting it (e.g. with encryption). Some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping). However, powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out of the bag and the ``genie cant be put back in the bottle. In less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable. To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration of secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst, mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility. Electronic privacy issues, and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years. ANONYMITY ========= _____ <3.1> What is `anonymity on the internet? Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on this simple theme. A person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle and establish a reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity. A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run). Or, a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an `anonymous return address. A user may wish to appear as a `regular user but actually be untraceable. Sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups. A user may wish to access some service and hide all signs of the association. All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity. _____ <3.2> Why is `anonymity (un)important on the internet? Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use. Arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it. It may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish. One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as employer/employee scenarios). One can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution. For example, `whistleblowers reporting on government abuses (economic, social, or political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants. Some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network. Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity. _____ <3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet? The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be effective as well, but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF guidelines. The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large. Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity. Virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet. New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication. _____ <3.4> What is `anonymous mail? One approach to `anonymizing mail has been to set up an `anonymous server that, when activated by email to its address, responds by allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID that is unique to the person requesting it (based on his email address). This will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination. The server `anonymizes the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. This is the `interactive use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above. Another more `fringe approach is to run a `cypherpunk remailer from a regular user account (no root system privileges are required). These are currently being pioneered by Eric Hughes and Hal Finney The operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a PERL script running on UNIX. Several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable; they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge. The remailers dont generally support anonymous return addresses. Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system, although actually may be held liable regardless. These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses: - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous IDs to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely. One alternative is to allow `deallocation of aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been implemented yet. - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the `outside, necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection,. - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local, network, or government agencies. - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them. - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable to their own system administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered, regarding it as illicit use. - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user. Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information. This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators. Information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site. In practice, this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out. Some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently. See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity. _____ <3.5> What is `anonymous posting? Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic, capricious or risky local circumstances, logging). Make sure to test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to misc.test (however some operators dont recommend this because many sites `autorespond to test messages, possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting before proceeding. Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information. This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators, and similar consequences can ensue. See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity. _____ <3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet? As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community, and these services should be used with great caution. To summarize, the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not completely trustworthy. No standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent. Here are some encountered and potential bugs: - One anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses. - Others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered. - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common. - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem, possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email address mappings in the alias file. This can be remedied with the use of passwords. - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers. Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly. The field is not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agencies. The whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality. The major objection to anonymity over regular internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints. System adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows. This may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers. Probably the least problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer, e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files. _____ <3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet? New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity. For example, the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy, can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination. In this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be `broken for security to be compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely. Even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation) would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible. The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time, highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in `serious groups. The introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt groups have had in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the charter may specify whether `anonymous posting is (un)welcome. Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences. However, if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground. The ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized. Conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social acceptance of Usenet. * * * This is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ, obtained via anonymous FTP to or newsgroups news.answers, sci.answers, alt.answers every 21 days.

If nothing is inherently >worthwhile or desirable, then simple theories with accurate predictions >are not inherently worthwhile or desirable. Do you see any flaws in this? The problem is, your use of the word \"objective\" along with \"values.\" Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see, what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless. >If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness, >or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are. Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \"worth\" is subjective. >#If you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will >#be a good beginning. >Im not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective >basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in >dealing with observed facts. Alternatively, you could try to >demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful, worthy >or important in any situation. In other words, I need to know >how you use the term \"objective\". When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard I use. Here is a definiton of objective: objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance. 3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on observable phenomenon. By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the phrase \"objective worth\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and thus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument. However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \"good\") is subjective. I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth, value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality. >Frank ODwyer Im not hatching That from \"Hens\", by Evelyn Conlon eric \n"

Reply-To: (Serdar Argic) Distribution: world Lines: 208 In article writes: >In your (and Mutlu/Argic/Cosars and thousands of others like you) SDPA.ORG criminals/Nazis in action. Your fascist government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away with the genocides cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished. Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank, Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives, children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of 3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from occupying the city. The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the neighbourhood. They burned Omer Aghas nephew alive. They raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them. At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar, Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat. Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four villages, including Gulli-Guzat.

They pursued a relentless policy of murder and extinction everywhere. This was responsible for the tragic incident at Maras....the Armenians had completely destroyed an old Mohammedan town like Maras by their artillery and machine-gun fire. They killed thousands of innocent and defenceless women and children. The Armenians were the instigators of the atrocities, which were unique in history.

Kinda fun. 8) First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom. Check the numbers on it. It should be the only non-smt chip on the board. Slightly below center, and left. The bios should read either : 62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2 If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems. > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: (\"-\" represents jumper) > W1 1-2 3 > W2 1-2 3 > W3 1-2 > W4 1 2-3 > W5 1 2 3 > W6 1-2 3 > W7 1 2 3 Looks right. W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. >The drive jumpers are as follows: (\"8\" represents jumper) Looks right. [art deleted] >Here are my questions: > >1.) Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other? I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings. Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has. If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this: 5 + + open 6 + + open 7 + + open 8 + + open 4 + + closed 3 + + closed 2 + + open 1 + + open Note: those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom. +s represent the jumper pins. Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1). If you have the 62-000094 rom, its a auto-config, and Ill have to look up how to do it... I dont have the big book right here. >2.) Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly? See above. You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right. Also, at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8). On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive. Its one or the other. The narrow data cable goes to J2. Ive thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day..... >3.) Is my systems BIOS in need of an upgrade? Dunno. IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82. A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug. Enter: -d f000:fff5 fffc (the - is the debug prompt) This will return the rom date, if its of any use. >Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

NOTE 1: AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive. When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not \"boot.\" To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled. To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT controller you are using). -2- NOTE 2: TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or \"A\" version. These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard. To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7. Then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7). To complete the modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 (2 rows of 8 pins). PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD. To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position W-27. This will change the interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

All necessary drivers and receivers are included, permitting direct cable connections to the SCSI bus through a 50 pin connector and to the AT bus through two edge connectors. The 7000-ASC utilizes jumper configurable options that enable the address space, DMA channels and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end users application. The board also features word data transfer at 4 megabytes per second (synchronous), an on-board floppy disk controller and a ROM BIOS. Please note that the 7000-ASC operates using standard DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3 only. 7000-FASST2 - This SCSI host adapter card provides the same features as the 7000-ASC plus additional support capabilities using software developed by Columbia Data Products. The 7000- FASST2 will support MS-DOS 3.2-3.3, Compaq DOS 3.31, PC-DOS 4.0, PC-MOS/386 version 2.1, XENIX, Microsoft Windows, Novell and Sytos tape backup. WDATXT-FASST KIT - An \"unintelligent\" SCSI host adapter that is compatible with the IBM XT, AT and compatible systems. It uses a 50 pin external SCSI bus \"D\" connector with a standard 50 pin internal SCSI cable. The WDATXT-FASST can be used as both a target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for SCSI designers. It also provides a low cost alternative for end- users desiring to install a SCSI peripheral device such as a hard disk drive or a tape backup unit. The kit includes an 8-bit SCSI HBA board, manual, FASST software diskettes and an internal SCSI cable. SYTOS TAPE BACKUP - (Utility for 7000-FASST) - FASST-SYTOS - FASST version of Sytos tape backup utilities. MS-DOS compatible, it runs with FASST software products Revision 3.3+. HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR PS/2 MODEL 50, 60, 80 SYSTEMS (MICROCHANNEL ARCHITECTURE) WD1006V-MC1, feature F300R - Hard disk controller with an ST506/ST412 interface for microchannel systems. It supports 2 MFM drives with up to 16 heads and 2048 cylinders, 1:1 interleave and faster data transfer due to \"look ahead caching.\" The\"V\" boards can run in high speed AT systems (10 to 16 megahertz system speed). -8- WD1007V-MC1, feature F300R - This controller card will support up to 2 ESDI hard disk drives, 15 megabit per second transfer rate and it contains a ROM BIOS with \"shadow RAM\" that will enable the controller card to interface with all types of ESDI hard disk drives without modifying the system BIOS. It uses 1:1 interleave. The \"V\" boards can run in high speed AT systems, (10 to 12 megahertz bus speed). CONTROLLERS FOR FLOPPY DISK DRIVES ONLY WD1002A-FOX - Half-slot floppy disk controller for XT or AT systems. Four versions of the board are available: Feature F001 supports two floppy disk drives. Feature F002 supports four floppy disk drives and includes an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector and an optional 4-pin power connector. Feature F003 supports two floppy disk drives and includes a ROM BIOS that will enable your system to recognize floppy disk drives that may not be supported by your AT system ROM BIOS. The optional ROM BIOS will also allow this controller card to operate high density floppy disk drives in an XT system. Feature F004 supports four floppy disk drives and includes an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector, an optional 4-pin power connector and a ROM BIOS that will enable your system to recognize floppy disk drives that may not be supported by your AT system ROM BIOS. The optional ROM BIOS will also allow this controller card to operate high density floppy disk drives in an XT system. -- Prof. L.

      "23 From: (Jon Leech) Subject: Space FAQ 11/15 - Upcoming Planetary Probes Supersedes: Organization: University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Lines: 243 Distribution: world Expires: 6 May 1993 20:00:01 GMT NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.edu Keywords: Frequently Asked Questions Archive-name: space/new_probes Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:17 $ UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits. ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20 Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters. CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997. After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturns atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturns satellites, and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface. One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere. The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturns rings. Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory) ------------------------------------------------------------- 10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch 04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist 06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist 08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist 12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist 06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival 01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release 01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry 06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission (Schedule last updated 7/22/92) GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve approximately 70% of its original objectives.

Has made multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite, into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon. MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity map. MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera. Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for one martian year (687 days). TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched 8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years, substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean. ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera. Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiters north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Suns south pole in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- thats right, a solar-studies spacecraft thats always further from the Sun than the Earth is! While in Jupiters neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical detail, see the many articles in the same issue. OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro Yamada Im attempting to track changes based on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome. 1993 Missions o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus] ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform a wide-field sky survey in the \"soft\" (low-energy) X-ray spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch for more information. o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket] Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere. o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01] Gather radar images of Earths surface. o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket] Study of Stratospheric ozone. o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS] Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be recovered after it conducts the various scientific and engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994. 1994 o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket] June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the Earth. o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02] International Microgravity Laboratory. o ADEOS [NASDA] Advanced Earth Observing Satellite. o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS] Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves. 1995 LUNAR-A [ISAS] Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the moons interior. Proposed Missions: o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF) Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for 15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe. o Earth Observing System (EOS) Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science including planetary evolution. o Mercury Observer Possible 1997 launch. o Lunar Observer Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moons poles, would survey characteristics to provide a global context for the results from the Apollo program. o Space Infrared Telescope Facility Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant infrared-emitting galaxies o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR) Robotics rover would return samples of Mars atmosphere and surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover. o Fire and Ice Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in 2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking measurements of our stars upper atmosphere until it is vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016. NEXT: FAQ #12/15 - Controversial questions \n"

Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track. Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1 You cant tell exactly by the numbers. Furthermore, the Integra will definately outrun the Beretta on the high end. Car & Driver and Road & track have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast. > So, the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep >up with it in acceleration.

You can rev that car all day, everyday, and youll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak from expierence!) Im not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but dont highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine. AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better. And does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time. NOTE: this isnt a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products. THe Berreta is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention, it has an Airbag. But to start quoting figures from one source, isnt too reliable. Read other sources, and drive both cars. While I havent driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines, (so they are similair.) \n"

It discusses the forms of \"kleros\" (eg: kleros, kleroo, etc), and the various meanings of \"kleros\" (eg: \"plot of land,\" and \"inheritance\"), but mentions nothing about CHORION or \"burial plot.\" (Why does this not surprise me?)

It is my habit to check my articles before and after their submission for errors. In my last article I stated: > (By the way Mr DeCenso, you really should have looked in the index of your > Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich Greek lexicon.

Thus > it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference). I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus confused \"kleros\", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of land discussed. In actuality it is \"chorion\", which is the last word Acts 1:18. Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss \"chorion\" so I cannot report as to the nuances of the word. I dont know if someone else would have caught this, though I am sure that someone would be able to do so, but I have an aversion to disseminating mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point\" _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY... Vary noble of you Dave. I didnt want to have to go to x number of sources to show you wrong. (Although I am researching CHORION a little). DB... \"Of course the only other reference Mr DeCenso has given is Bullinger. And Bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when I accused Mr DeCenso of actually believing Bullinger, he replied that I misquoted him: >> \"And you maintain that you find such exegesis convincing? Oh dear.\" > > My Reply... > Your misquotes of me are astounding, Dave. Read the beginning of this part of > my response to see what I REALLY said in my posting of this article. [Actually Mr DeCenso, you said that there was \"benefit\" to our argument, in that it caused to to rediscover Bullingers exegisis. I did not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by it].\" MY REPLY... Thank you for correcting your restating of my points. DB... \"and Mr DeCenso also replied: > Dave, these are not necessarily my views; they are Bullingers. WE will > discuss the land issue in later posts, Im sure. Im only responding to >this one you have directed re: Bullingers views because its enjoyable. Thus I apologize for thinking that even Mr DeCenso could find such \"drek\" convincing....he should specify which parts of Bullinger he finds convincing and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of \"This is what Bullinger believed, not necessarily what I believe.\" So which is it Mr DeCenso? Do you find the exegisis convincing or not?)\" MY REPLY... One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various Bible scholars and students alike. When I present MY VIEWS, I will clearly distinguish them from now on. DB... \"Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented no Greek exegisis at all, and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual Greek. Thus we find this demand on his part for quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement.\" MY REPLY... Good point. But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. Nor have you dug deeper. Im glad you have begun in this post. I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary, as well. DB... \"It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence. Now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it often enough: > (a) the text itself > (b) parallel passages > (c) other pertinent Scriptures > (d) historical context > (e) historical content > (f) other pertinent historical info > (g) cultural context > (h) cultural content > (i) other pertinent cultural info > (j) grammatical construction > (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies > (l) etc. But are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole. Lets see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages, we see that he has also used (b). On the other hand he has presented no use of: (d) historical context or (e) historical content or (f) other pertinent historical info or (g) cultural context or (h) cultural content or (i) other pertinent cultural info or (j) grammatical construction or even (k) Hebrew and Greek word studies [remember, Archer and Bullinger dont count] Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings.\" MY REPLY... Question: Do you find such criteria important? If so, do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present shallow observations (I dont mean this in a bad way). At this point in our _debates_, I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses. I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re: Judas in Acts and Matthew, but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria, since you desire me to. I hope you will also. It will greatly enhance our study of these passages. DB... \"The only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other passage. Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be: > (a) the text itself > (b) parallel passages MY REPLY... The reason is simple...you are mistating the passages. You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another. (1) They may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention; (2) Matthew may not be presenting Judas death, as you claim. But well look at your defense of this later. Also, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthews PASSAGES. (Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is). At this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis. DB... \"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas death, is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct.\" MY REPLY... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary. However, I see no problem in Tony Roses explanation of Judas death... _____________________________________________________________________ HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\" ============================================================= This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error. Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at all. Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do they necessarily contradict each other? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be true and supplementary. A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined. From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall. Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself. This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time. On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the case of Matthews and Peters accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event. _____________________________________________________________________ Your only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit inerrancy. You havent related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely. Heres what you said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________ DB [quoting Tony Rose]... > There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. > Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks > on this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > was the decomposition of his body before his fall. \"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible. But you seem to find Tony Roses eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David Joslins.\" _____________________________________________________________________ Here, you discredit Tonys explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for the passages. But you havent addressed why you feel that way. You can say its a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesnt tell me it didnt happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility. Questions: Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying? Or are they both lying? Or are either or both of them misinformed? Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction? I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect. DB... \"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me: > (1) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas > death. I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas > died in the hanging. > (2) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down > in the temple and the chief priests used, is the \"reward of iniquity\" > in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with; > therefore there is a contradiction. Prove that the 30 pieces of silver > and the \"reward of iniquity\" are one and the same. Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points. First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life. In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\" MY REPLY... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect. Today, I got a call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack. He failed in his attempt and is in a childs psych ward at a local hospital. Hanging attempts are not always successful. To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is \"begging the question\", if I may quote you. [Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian Research Institutes show, one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use. I am not all that familiar with them. The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic. It was interesting] DB... \"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\" MY REPLY... Qualifiers are important at times, as well see in an OT passage Ill mention below. Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome? Did Matthew, who is the only source we have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result? To say its synonymous means it has the same meaning as. A boy (age 14) hung himself. But he lived. This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover. DB... \"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\" MY REPLY... Thank you, Dave. DB... \"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide. ^^^^^^^^^^^ MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] So its OK to use Christian sources to back your points? What about Tonys position. Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility? Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or deceived in other parts of their books? If so, should we do, as we have done with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including their \"interpretation\" of the hanging of Judas? I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources. You also noted they \"interpreted\" the hanging as meaning he died.

I appreciate your doing this research, Dave. Maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth study. DB... \"In each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation of Matt 27:5 as successful, suicide and thus I can only conclude that the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Greek word \"apagchw\"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging.\" MY REPLY... [^^^ above, mine] No you cant only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly probable outcome. But Matthew does not state death as being a result. The Greek word is APAGCHO. Matthew 27:5 is its only occurrence in the New Testament. In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), its only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he was buried in his fathers tomb.\" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\". Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died. Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure. It simply means \"hang oneself\". DB... \"But Mr DeCenso, you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful.\" MY REPLY... [^^^above, mine] \"Reputable\"? You mean ones that have never erred? As far as insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that cant be done, even by me. ^^^^^^^^^ As I said in an earlier post... _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tonys exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas death (taking into account several criteria), Ive recently noticed some new things in Matthew. MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging. All it says is that he \"went and hanged himself.\" Luke however, in Acts, tells us that \"and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the other details given in Acts - Peters speech, the need to pick a new apostle, etc.) that at least after Judas fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas death is highly probable, but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut. ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________ I also wrote... _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY... Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed. Lets look at the passage in Matthew: MAT 27:4 saying, \"I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.\" And they said, \"What is that to us? You see to it!\" MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself. MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.\" MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potters field, to bury strangers in. MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Notice verse 5...\"Then he...went and hanged himself.\" Matthew does not say Judas died, does it? Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say? ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it; and, Let another take his office. Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas death....So, my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the \"two\" accounts of Judas death is this...Matthew doesnt necessarily explain how Judas died; he does ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas \"hanged himself\", but he didnt specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise. Therefore, there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas `death. ....... MY REPLY... ...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death. Although its possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case. Therefore, no contradiction. Matthew did not say Judas died as a ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging, did he? Most scholars believe he probably did, but...? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________ I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we cant assume Judas died. It is, however, highly probable. ^^^^^^ DB... \"By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing. One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthews version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts. \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\" suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly exploded (which doesnt explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesnt explain how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\" MY REPLY... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc. In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some... _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process. The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined. From the bottom of the valley, you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular. There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down, tearing his body open. _____________________________________________________________________ DB... Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potters field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is correct: Matthew does make that confusion. Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the prophesy of the Potters field came from).\" MY REPLY... Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you. DB... As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source. I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\"). Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\" MY REPLY... Dave, we are getting somewhere, arent we! ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said, ACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus; ACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\" ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out. ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.) ACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his dwelling place be desolate, And let no one live in it; and, Let another take his office. Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used. Rather, it states that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\" What part did Judas play in their ministry? ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had said to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give something to the poor. So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se. Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer, according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of iniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field. I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the \"wages of iniquity\" are. What do you think, Dave? DB... \"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking me what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\" MY REPLY... I will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have that big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.

      "29 From: Subject: How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation Lines: 154 Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?). I decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones. Not long after I got into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation. Im going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 supplements. Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys). Vitamin C will form oxalic acid. But large doses are needed (above 6 grams per day). 1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev. 5(3):110-129(1985). But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases). For both glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, but to increase your intake of vitamin B6. 2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988) 200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program. 3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38 :277-86(1970). Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels. For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases). For vitamin C, the effect is quite different. There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism. The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid. But this is highly variable and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic acid. At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid. In a very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day. Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation. B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body. There are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we dont know about yet. Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires B6. Differences in B6 levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism). Increasing your intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin C supplements. Since the typical American diet is deficient in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut). Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309 -15,1980). If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion. Here are the high oxalate foods: 1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea. Contain at least 25mg/100grams 2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe. Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams. If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection. A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all. If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldnt have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months). The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S. Coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 excretion in the urine. Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol, isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids. I tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the B6 requirement. The dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your dietary intake of B6). Any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given B6 supplements. One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1. Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium-oxalate. 4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest. Urol 10:147(1972) 5. \"Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium interaction\"J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990). 6.Review Article, \"Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones\" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987). There are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for B6. I thought that I was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I guess that he doesnt read the medical literature. Oh well, since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought Id tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctors office.
